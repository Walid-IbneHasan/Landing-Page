I have used ReactJS, React Icons, Tailwind CSS for design. I have chosen tailwind because its almost similar to raw css with just the utility classes which makes the work simpler and easier. 
Steps to run  locally: Just install the packages using NPM i after downloading the zip or cloning via ssh key or https. It should run fine after using the command npm run dev.
